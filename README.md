some assignments from classes at J Sarge
These are mostly projects that I did in 2006/2007. Please focus more on the code itself as opposed to any text or graphic content as these were simply fun projects and not intended to look "professional" please refer to my more recent projects and see the evolution in my work. These assignments are posted solely to show my diverse range of skills. Thank you for your understanding.
